OpenCore EFI For Lenovo IDEAPAD Slim 3 16ABR8
Only support macOS 11 (BigSur) 
When installing macOS 12 (Monterey), the installer hangs at 13-12 minutes.
What doesn't work:
Camera, Wifi and Bluetooth
After BigSur, no macOS will install or boot
Everything works except what doesn't work.
Attention, in macOS there is no battery level and in general it is impossible to see how many percent. Because Kext is needed. Perhaps EFI will be updated.
To see the installers in the OpenCore boot menu, press space.
Good luck!
